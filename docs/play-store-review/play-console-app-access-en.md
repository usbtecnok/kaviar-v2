## Background location usage in KAVIAR Driver

KAVIAR Driver uses background location only when the driver is online or during a ride.

This permission is required to:

- keep the driver available on the platform;
- receive nearby ride requests;
- update the driver's position during a ride;
- allow the passenger to follow the ride progress;
- support safety and operational support.

Background location is not used for advertising, selling data, or tracking outside the operational context of the mobility platform.

## Google Play Console notes

The test accounts must be valid before submitting the app for review.

If any flow depends on a real ride, manual approval, or regional availability, the reviewer should be informed that the provided test account is prepared to access the main app screens without being blocked.
